        <h1>Commentary</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Commentary is a type of expression where you can explain your opinions based on an event or <br> situation. This is where you can state your insights or view behind the topic
            that is made, at the same time, it  should make sense. There <br> are two types of Commentary in  YouTube actually. The Drama Commentary and the Mixed Commentary.
        </p>
        <div class="boxes">
            <div class="box1">
                <h2>Drama commentary</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Drama commentary is based on the latest dramas and <br> controversy on the internet between big topics and subjects. Content creators like 
                    <br>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/memeulous">Memeulous</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDEn-Tq2UQyS3YvK0NNHqjQ">Tagswag</a> and more creates
                a video commenting about the latest situation or trends.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                <h2>Mixed Commentary</h2>
                <p>Mixed Commentary is the type of commentary that <br> creates mixed content on what was posted or trends. <br> You could 
                    give comment to  someone's videos, picture and <br>other genres of contents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/penguinz0">Penguinz0</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SomeOrdinaryGamers">SomeOrdinaryGamers</a>
                  are the <br> example of Mixed Commentary creators.</p>

    <h1>Demographics</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Mostly, Teenagers and adults are the primary target audience for this type of content. They are mostly teens. 
        The humor absolutely tells you without saying who the types of audiences are who agree with the youtuber's thoughts and points 
        of view on many topics. Reviewing of products such as reviewing of newly released phones or unboxing of albums are under this content 
    since vloggers state their opinions when they review products. Gaming can also be under commentary content since gamers also tell what they think about the updates of the game.</p>

        <h1>The Needs of the Demographics</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Myje Montanez, as a part of an audience for Commentary, I target the content creators' opinion and decide whether he or she agrees or disagrees depending on the 
            situation on what he or she's talking about.
            We observed the comments from the content are related to the topic. Either they joke about it, rant about it, or comment their opinions about it.
            In research we found that there are a few things that are required for target audiences to enjoy your content.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>These are the suggestions we can provide to make the audience like your video.</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="tips">
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>>Being passionate and incisive about a certain topic.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>When recording your videos, be excited. Many beginning commentators make the mistake of being either too quiet or too loud. You're not trying to break anyone's ears, 
                        but you are attempting to convey that you are genuinely eager and passionate about performing, and that you are deserving of the opportunity to do so.
                        Within the first 30 seconds, most individuals will decide whether or not they want to watch a video. There are many other deciding variables, but this is a key one. 
                        This means you just have 30 seconds to amaze them with stuff they haven't seen before. This means you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket and wow them right away, 
                        then go dull.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <li>>Having a nice audio quality</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Audio quality is just as important as game performance. Seananners is an excellent example of good audio. He values high-quality audio above all else, 
                    and I think that's fantastic! He won't upload anything unless he's absolutely certain it's to his finest abilities. This is just how you ought to be.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>>Sponsorship or partnership</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Helps you to have more viewers for your content. The other YouTube channel's viewers or fans can view your content. 
                        This is like mutualism where both of you benefit from what you are doing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>>Choose a nice place to do your recording process.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>This helps you to focus on what you are saying during recording while nothing else can distract you. Make your background even much better to impress your viewers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li>>Be updated on what is recently happening in the media.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>This helps you to create more videos so your channel won't be dead. You can have any Social Medias accounts to be updated on what's happening right now and
                        have an epic new video about a new issue because when a day comes by, so does the arguments comes in.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <li>Make sure you really know the topic you are going to talk about.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>By this, you can really know what you are saying while filming your comments and at the same time, your comments can make sense.</p>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than just reporting events, the goal of commentary is to offer readers with a method to make sense of them. 
                    A commentary will aid you in critically examining a topic and writing about it in the perspective of a larger societal context.
                    The commentary's listener must be engaged in the topic in order to relate to it.
                    The content creator must be very knowledgeable about the topic on which he is about to speak, and the creator must be able to explain why he or she 
                    believes what he or she believes. This is all we can give and I hope this is helpful for ya.
